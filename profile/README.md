Welcome to the PythonMC Minecraft School Network! We were proud to be one of the most exciting and entertaining Minecraft networks during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Our network offered a unique gaming experience with a focus on education and creativity.

## About Us (Past)

### Our Game Mode: Minecraft School

PythonMC Minecraft School was our flagship game mode that allowed players to learn and play in a virtual school environment. Here are some of the features that set our server apart:

- **Creativity**: We encouraged our players to unleash their creativity by building their structures, artwork, and Redstone contraptions. There were even building projects inspired by famous real-world landmarks.

- **Community**: Our network fostered a friendly and supportive community of players and teachers. Players could collaborate in groups, ask questions, and learn from each other.

### Highlights (Past)

- Over 100 unique educational missions and challenges.
- Regular events and competitions for players of all ages.
- Active administrators and teachers who cared about the well-being of the players.

## How to Join (Past)

Unfortunately, the PythonMC Minecraft School Network server is no longer online and was discontinued after the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.
